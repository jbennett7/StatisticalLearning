# Goal
This repo is intended to be a repository for my learnings in [James](#1). I will use it in conjunction with the [Stanford Course](https://www.edx.org/learn/statistics/stanford-university-statistical-learning?index=product&queryID=897d4ba5f455937c19c8c749db15ac94&position=5&linked_from=autocomplete&c=autocomplete).

The goal is to complete the course and to collect all the knowledge into this repository. Over time I will refine the information into a complete reference to Statistical Learning with references from other sources.
